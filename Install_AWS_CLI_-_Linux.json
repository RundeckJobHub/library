The AWS CLI would need to be installed on the Server or Enterprise Runner where the job is executing from.\n\n### Requirements\n\n- This job will only run on Linux based systems with `apt-get` available to install required packages.\n- Python 2.7 will be installed and is required for the S3 job step plugins.\n- The AWS CLI will be installed which is required for the S3 job step plugins and some jobs provided in our pre-built solutions.\n\nIf the job is unsuccessful you will need to install and configure the AWS CLI directly on the machines.\n[AWS CLI Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html)",
